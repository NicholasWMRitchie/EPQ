/**
 * <p>
 * While active, this listener keeps an internal record of energy deposition
 * events. These events represent energy lost to the material at the event's
 * location in a form that can effect change (e.g., expose resist or generate
 * heat). The detector's record can subsequently be interrogated, for example to
 * determine the deposited energy within a desired volume.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For this purpose, energy deposition includes (1) energy lost by a primary
 * electron (PE) due to a continuous slowing down model associated with its
 * motion, (2) energy lost in inelastic scattering events, and (3) when an
 * electron is dropped from further simulation, the difference between whatever
 * energy it had remaining at that time and the energy of a fully equilibrated
 * electron in the material at its location. (For example, in a material with a
 * partially filled conduction band, the equilibrated electron is assumed to
 * retain a kinetic energy equal to the Fermi energy. This is not included in
 * the deposited energy.) Secondary electron (SE) generation results in (4) a
 * negative deposit (a withdrawal) of energy that is carried away by the SE. The
 * value that is logged is the net deposit of energy at the location of the
 * scattering.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that certain changes in PE kinetic energy are not considered to be
 * deposited energy. For example, when an electron transitions between
 * materials, its kinetic energy may increase or decrease due to a difference in
 * the potential energy between materials. Such a decrease or increase is not
 * deemed to be an energy deposit or withdrawal at the boundary crossing,
 * although energy gained at that point may be later lost (and counted) in
 * subsequent events. Kinetic energy changes due to the electron's motion in an
 * electric field may or may not be counted as deposited energy, depending on
 * the order in which listeners are polled when there is an event. If this
 * DepositedEnergyListener is added to MonteCarloSS's list of active listeners
 * after the ChargingListener is added, then this one will be polled first
 * (since MonteCarloSS uses a last added/first polled order). In that case
 * energy that goes into or is taken from the field is not counted as deposited
 * energy. (This is recommended, since energy lost to the field does not heat or
 * cause chemical changes in the sample.) If the ChargingListener is added to
 * the list last, then energy flows into and out of the field are included in
 * the deposited energy.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The detector may be polled after a simulation. Methods provide ways to access
 * the internal record of loss events. These include dump(), which creates a
 * possibly very large ASCII file listing each event on a separate line,
 * getDepositedEnergy(Shape s), which is a very general (and slow) method that
 * returns the total deposited energy within any supplied arbitrary s, and
 * getDepositedEnergy(double[] testShapeCenter, double[] testShapeHalfSize)
 * which is a is a much more efficient method for returning deposited energy in
 * box-shaped volumes with sides oriented along the coordinate axes. Other
 * methods return the total number of trajectories started and the number of
 * electrons that exited the chamber while the listener was active. Getters are
 * provided for several totals: energy in, energy out, and
 * sampleDepositedEnergy. These are respectively the total kinetic energy of new
 * electrons at TrajectoryStartEvents, the total kinetic energy of those
 * electrons that exit the chamber, and the total of energy deposit events
 * exclusive of chamber exit events. Usually it is roughly the case that
 * energyIn = energyOut + sampleDepositedEnergy, but this equivalence is only
 * approximate because, as described above, the definition of deposited energy
 * excludes certain energies (electrostatic potential energy, kinetic energy
 * retained by equilibrated electrons, potential energy differences among
 * materials) that would need to be accounted for separately in order to make a
 * detailed energy balance.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The internal record of deposited energy is detailed only for events within a
 * rectangular bounding volume supplied to the constructor. This volume is
 * divided in half along each dimension, i.e., into octants, up to a
 * user-settable (Constructor parameter) maxDivisions times. Octants are only
 * instantiated when there is an event for them to hold. When there is a second
 * event, octants are divided as many times as needed to place the events in
 * different octants, except that if this requires more than maxDivisions, the
 * events are summed in the same minimum-sized octant. Thus the spatial
 * resolution of the record in the x direction is the x dimension of the
 * bounding volume divided by 2^maxDivisions, and similarly for the y and z
 * directions. Larger values of maxDivisions thus correspond to better spatial
 * resolution at the cost of higher memory usage.
