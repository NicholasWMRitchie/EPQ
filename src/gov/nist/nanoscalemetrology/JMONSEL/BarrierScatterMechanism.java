	/**
	 * Simulates scattering of an electron at a barrier. The routine accepts a
	 * reference to the primary electron (PE), from which it may ascertain the
	 * electron's current region. It also accepts a reference (nextregion) to the
	 * RegionBase on the other side of the boundary. If the electron is transmitted,
	 * the PE region is updated to nextregion and its energy and trajectory are
	 * altered as needed to simulate the scattering event. If it is reflected its
	 * trajectory is updated. If a secondary electron is produced, barrierScatter
	 * creates one with appropriate energy and trajectory and returns it. Otherwise
	 * it returns null.
