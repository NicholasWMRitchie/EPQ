/**
 * <p>
 * An abstract class for defining scatter mechanisms. A scatter mechanism (e.g.,
 * Elastic scattering, Moller SE generation, plasmon SE generation, Gryzinski SE
 * generation,...) Such a mechanism represents a type of event, characterized by
 * its likelihood of occurring and its effects if it does occur.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Its likelihood of occurring may be characterized by a cross section, mean
 * free path, or scatting rate. Here we use scattering rate. It is in general a
 * function of the material in which the electron is traveling and the
 * electron's kinetic energy.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If an event does occur, its effect on the primary electron is characterized
 * by a new energy and direction of travel. It also generates an SE with some
 * probability (possibly 0, as for instance for elastic scattering). If it
 * generates an SE, the SE must be assigned an initial energy and direction of
 * motion.
