/**
 * <p>
 * A ScanGenerator is a class that provides methods to simplify managing
 * sequential positioning of the beam. The essential feature of a scan generator
 * is that it associates an index (0, 1, 2, ...) with a point [x,y,z,t] in space
 * and time. When constructed the generator's index is initialized to -1 and the
 * corresponding coordinates to NaN. Basic usage is to call the next() method,
 * which increments the index, returns the corresponding [x,y,z,t] value, and
 * sets the simulation's TimeKeeper so its time is t. Besides next(), a number
 * of other methods are provided. Only next(), reset(), and setIndex() change
 * the value of the index (hence what position comes next) and the state of the
 * TimeKeeper. The other methods, current(), currentIndex(), and get(), provide
 * information about the current state of the ScanGenerator or its state at a
 * specified index.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class is abstract because the get() method is left to be implemented by
 * a child class. This method is the one that associates a particular value of
 * [x,y,z,t] with a given index, and its implementation will vary depending upon
 * whether the class is implementing a linescan, rectangular raster scan, etc.
 * However, the implementing class need ONLY implement the get() method. Default
 * operations of the other methods are provided by this parent class.
