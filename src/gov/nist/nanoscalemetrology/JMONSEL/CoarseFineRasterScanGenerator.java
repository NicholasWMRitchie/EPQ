/**
 * <p>
 * A ScanGenerator for a combined coarse/fine raster. This kind of scan provides
 * a good compromise between speed and accuracy in some charging simulations.
 * The problem with an ordinary raster-scan is that the pixels are so close to
 * each other that pixel i+1 can't be properly simulated until an FEA has been
 * performed to account for charges deposited during pixel i. However, doing an
 * FEA after each pixel is very time-consuming.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This scan generator divides the scanned area into ncx * ncy coarse (i.e.,
 * large) pixels. Each coarse pixel is subdivided into nx * ny fine pixels.
 * Raster scans of coarse pixels (rastered over the image) and fine pixels
 * (rastered over each coarse pixel) are then interleaved in such a way that the
 * first fine pixel in each coarse pixel is done, then the second fine pixel in
 * each coarse one, etc. In this way, successive pixels are relatively far apart
 * (a coarse instead of fine pixel size). It is a better approximation to ignore
 * the new charge distribution from these more distant neighbors than to ignore
 * it from the nearer neighbors of the usual raster-scan. If sizes are chosen
 * appropriately, more electrons can be run between FEA.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * X and Y scans are along the coordinate axes. The
 * CoarseFineRasterScanGenerator is characterized by parameters: <br>
 * x0 - initial x position <br>
 * y0 - initial y position <br>
 * z - z coordinate <br>
 * deltaX - pixel size in x direction <br>
 * deltaY - pixel size in y direction <br>
 * ncX - number of coarse pixels per line <br>
 * ncY - number of coarse lines per frame <br>
 * nfX - number of fine pixels per line in a coarse pixel <br>
 * nfY - number of fine lines in a coarse pixel <br>
 * t0 - time at the initial position <br>
 * pixelDwell - time between coarse pixels along the x direction <br>
 * retraceTime - time between completion of the last coarse pixel of a line and
 * start of the first coarse pixel of the next line <br>
 * frameSettleTime - time between completion of the last line of a coarse pass
 * through a frame and the start of the first line of the next coarse pass <br>
