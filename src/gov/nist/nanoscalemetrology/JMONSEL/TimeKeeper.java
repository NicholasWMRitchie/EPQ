/**
 * <p>
 * A class to facilitate time-dependent models. TimeKeeper keeps time in
 * seconds. It contains setters that are used to set the time. Example: the user
 * may have a scan generator that updates the time according to some model (so
 * much time between pixels within a line, so much additional time between
 * lines, so much additional time between frames, etc.) each time a new landing
 * position is selected. Models that depend upon time (e.g., conduction that
 * involves a finite RC time constant) can then access the time via TimeKeeper's
 * getTime() method. For convenience, TimeKeeper is implemented as a singleton
 * class. Any algorithm that uses getTimeKeeper will therefore be given access
 * to the same TimeKeeper, eliminating the need to pass it in the argument list.
