		 * intersects the ith plane at ui. Then the part of the line that is inside the
		 * half space defined by that plane is an interval, either (-infinity,ui] or
		 * [ui,infinity) depending upon whether it is an insidethisplane->outside or
		 * outside->insidethisplane transition. The n planes that make up this object
		 * define n such intervals. The intersection (in the set theoretic sense) of all
		 * of these intervals, call it [umin,umax], is the part of the line that is
		 * inside the shape. If umin>0 then our starting position at u=0 is outside of
		 * the shape and umin represents the closest boundary crossing (outside to in).
		 * If umin<0 then we start inside and umax represents the outward bound
		 * crossing. The result can be computed with a single loop through the planes by
		 * using two variables, umin and umax, to keep track of the end points of the
		 * intersection interval. umax starts at "infinity" and can only decrease. umin
		 * starts at -"infinity" and can only increase. Whenever we change an end point
		 * we store the index of the current plane. At the end we choose a u value
		 * corresponding to the nearest crossing with 0<u<=1 and the corresponding index
		 * is used to access the normal vector.

		 * We can optimize by noticing that certain situations signal immediately that
		 * no boundary crossing is possible. These situations are: (1) the line is
		 * parallel to and outside of any plane. (2) umax < 0 This signals that the
		 * entire "inside" is "behind" our line segment, at negative u. (3) umax < umin
		 * This signals that we have at least two completely disjoint intervals. There
		 * can be no position on this line that is inside all of them. (4) umin > 1 This
		 * signals that the entire "inside" is beyond the endpoint of our line segment.
		 * If any of these situations arise as we loop through the planes, we
		 * immediately abort, returning u>1 and undefined normal vector.
