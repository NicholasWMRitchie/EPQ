/**
 * <p>
 * Extends ScatterMechanism to create a Moller Inelastic mechanism. The Moller
 * mechanism applies to scattering of a primary electron from an unbound
 * stationary target electron in the material. The result is two electrons with
 * nonzero kinetic energy, one of which (the less energetic of the pair by
 * convention) we consider to be a secondary electron.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In a real material electrons typically come with a distribution of binding
 * energies. This is a problem because the Moller model is not strictly
 * applicable to electrons with binding energies &gt; 0. In practice, tightly
 * bound core electrons have low cross sections for secondary electron
 * production, so this implementation simply ignores them. Those with small
 * binding energies (defined here as those within 10 eV of vacuum level) are
 * treated in approximate fashion as though they are free.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This scattering mechanism uses the following material properties, which
 * therefore need to be properly defined: workfunction, bindingEnergy array, and
 * electronDensity array.

	 * and ignores the rest. The default threshold is 10 eV. Although any such sharp
	 * cutoff between "free" and "bound" is necessarily a crude approximation, such
	 * is what we are forced to do by using a model that applies only to free
	 * electrons, as this Moller model does. 10 eV seems a reasonable place to put
	 * the dividing line. The original MONSEL assigned nve = 4 to Si. Since
	 * silicon's valence band (which contains those 4 electrons) extends to almost
	 * 20 eV below the vacuum level, that original choice corresponded a 20 eV
	 * threshold, a choice that on reflection we think too high. Choosing a lower
	 * threshold allows the residual energy loss (in the original MONSEL stopping
	 * power formula) to be smaller, and this is on the whole a good thing. The
	 * default choice of cutoff can be altered by specifying a different one in the
