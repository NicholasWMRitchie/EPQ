/**
 * <p>
 * Implements the ElectronGun interface for an electron gun that produces a
 * hourglass-shaped beam in a user-specified direction with a Gaussian
 * distribution of electrons at best focus. "Gaussian" here means that at best
 * focus the probability that an electron's position will be a distance between
 * r and r + dr from the center of the spot is r * Exp[-r^2/(2 sigma^2)] * dr.
 * Hourglass-shaped means the electrons converge from above best-focus and
 * diverge below it.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The axis of symmetry of the beam (average direction of electrons) can be
 * specified by the setBeamDirection() method. The default is [0.,0.,1.]. (Note
 * that, like NISTMonte's GaussianBeam upon which this one is modeled, the beam
 * travels by default up the z axis. This facilitates use of the ElectronGun
 * with the same detectors used for GaussianBeam.) The beam center, set in the
 * constructor or by setCenter(), is the position of best focus. Electrons pass
 * through a plane perpendicular to the beam direction at this center point in a
 * 2-d Gaussian distribution. The standard deviation is set by the width
 * parameter in the constructor or setWidth(). The electron directions are
 * uniformly distributed in solid angle with a maximum deviation of
 * angularAperture (default 0.) from the mean beam direction. The initial
 * electron position is offset a distance (default 1 cm) from the best focus
 * position. From there, the electrons converge to the focus plane and then
 * diverge beyond it. (This allows parts of the sample above the best focus
 * position to realistically intercept incoming electrons.)
